## Defining subsidy–stress gradients for metals and relevance for US surface waters
### A working group of the USGS John Wesley Powell Center for Analysis and Synthesis


### Introduction
Many metals serve as both essential nutrients and potent toxicants, meaning they can constrain biology when their availability in the environment is either too low (i.e., subsidy) or too high (i.e., stress). Metals in US surface waters vary greatly both spatially and temporally, and it is likely that freshwatear organisms are exposed to both metal-limiting and toxic conditions. Our incomplete understanding of the potential effects of metal pollution is critical because human activities are increasingly manipulating metal availability in freshwaters.

__Overarching objective: Quantify the subsidy–stress gradient for 11 metals and determine overlap with current and future environmental concentrations in freshwaters of the US.__

We are a working group of ecologists, physiologists, ecotoxicologists, geochemists, and applied mathematicians that aim to generate a unified model describing the
biological role of metals from subsidy to stress. We will use this model in combination with a synthesis of metal bioavailability in rivers and streams to explore
spatiotemporal, taxonomic, and intra-metal variability in subsidy–stress gradients.
